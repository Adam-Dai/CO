A 3-bit binary up counter using JK lip flops is a counter circuit used in the field of digital electronics to count from binary 000 to binary 111, therefore the count is decimal 0 to decimal 7. The simplest circuit is the asynchronous one where the inverted output (/Q) from one stage feeds the clock pulse input (CK) of the following stage. In this circuit, the outputs are X, Y, and Z, where Z is the most significant bit.
